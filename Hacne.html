      <h4> Homeopathy medicines for effective Acne treatment </h4><br>
     <p>Homeopathy for acne is different from conventional treatment in that a homeopathic remedy is individualized to the person. Because every person is different, no single homeopathic remedy will work for everyone. A remedy is selected based on a personâ€™s unique set of symptoms, including (but not limited to) their acne symptoms. Therefore, seeking care with a homeopathic healthcare provider will likely result in the greatest success when treating acne.<br>
<br>
      <font><i>Below are just a few of the many possible remedies that homeopaths consider for treating acne:</i></font>
<br>
<font><b>Hepar sulph:</b></font>
 <br>pimples that are very painful; they may feel like a splinter in the skin. Lesions are very sensitive to touch and possibly cold. They may cluster in crops on the forehead and tend to form pustules and whiteheads easily. Discharge may smell like old cheese. In general, the person may be very chilly and oversensitive to pain, touch, cold, and slight causes.<br>
<font><b>Calcarea sulph: </b></font>
<br> severe cystic acne. Lesions persist in one place for weeks and do not heal quickly. Yellow, creamy pus drains for a long time. Unhealthy-looking skin with yellowish scabs. Pimples on face and near ears and hairline. Tendency to infections of the sinuses, ears, and tonsils that persist a long time. Person may be warm-blooded and feel worse in warm rooms.<br>
<font><b>Kali bromatum: </b></font>
<br> acne begins in the teen years and continues relentlessly into adulthood. Bluish, red pustules on the face, chest, and shoulders that leave scars, purple spots, or a depression in the skin. Pimples may have a depressed center or be painful, large red cysts with a white or yellow center. In females, the acne may be worse near the menstrual period. The person may have fidgety hands and feed, unpleasant dreams, restless sleep, and teeth grinding. They may be worse from warmth.<br>
<font><b>Pulsatilla: </b></font>
<br> acne in young girls that is associated with the onset of puberty. Acne that is associated with the menstrual period (especially when the period is irregular or absent) or with pregnancy. The person tends to have little thirst; to be weepy and like comfort and consolation; and to be chilly but like open, cool air and gentle motion.<br>
<font><b>Silica: </b></font>
<br> Deep, hard cystic acne, like boils on the face, especially the cheeks; pimples often to do not come to a head or show pus. Pimples are very slow to heal and leave pitting scars. The person tends to get infections easily and frequently. They may be chilly with sweaty hands and feet. They may be fatigued and lacking in strength and confidence, while also being obstinate with fixed ideas.<br>
<font><b>Sulphur: </b></font>
 <br>Acne with very oily skin. Blackheads are plentiful. Pimples and whiteheads are very large but not that deep. The face, especially the nose, is generally affected and tends to become reddened. Pimples may be painless but itchy. The skin may be rough and worse from washing. The acne may also be worse from heat, before the menstrual period, and from eating fatty foods. (This remedy is especially indicated for rosacea, a reddening of the face that causes acne-like eruptions.<br>
